## What is YokeBot?

YokeBot is an open-source AI agent workforce platform. You create agents, assign them tasks, skills, and goals, and they work autonomously on a heartbeat schedule — checking in, taking actions, and reporting back. Think of it as hiring tireless AI employees.

Key capabilities:
- Visual dashboard for non-developers
- Built-in team chat with channels, DMs, and @mentions
- Task management with human-in-the-loop approval workflows
- Knowledge base with RAG (document upload, embeddings, vector search)
- System of Record — custom data tables agents can CRUD
- Universal credit system for all usage (LLM, media, skills)
- Skills marketplace with SKILL.md format for custom tools
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for external tools
- Media generation: images (Flux), video (Kling, Wan), 3D (Hunyuan), music (ACE-Step), sound FX (MireloSFX)
- 12+ LLM models across multiple providers (DeepInfra, OpenRouter, fal.ai)
- Self-hosted (free, bring your own API keys) or cloud (yokebot.com, managed hosting)

## Quick Start

### Cloud (yokebot.com)
1. Sign up at https://yokebot.com
2. Pick a plan
3. Create your first agent from the dashboard

### Self-Hosted
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yokebots/yokebot.git
cd yokebot
pnpm install
cp packages/engine/.env.example packages/engine/.env
# Edit .env with your API keys
pnpm dev
```

### Docker Compose
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yokebots/yokebot.git
cd yokebot
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
docker compose up -d
```

## Architecture

- `packages/engine/` — Node.js/TypeScript backend (Express, SQLite or Postgres)
- `packages/dashboard/` — React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS frontend
- `skills/` — Bundled first-party skills (SKILL.md format)
- `ee/` — Enterprise/proprietary features

## Agents

Agents run on a configurable heartbeat cycle (5 minutes to 1 hour). Each check-in, the agent:
1. Reviews assigned tasks and goals
2. Reads new chat messages in its channels
3. Searches its knowledge base for context
4. Takes autonomous action using assigned skills
5. Reports back via chat messages or task updates

Agent configuration includes:
- Name, avatar, personality/system prompt
- Assigned skills (web search, media generation, custom tools)
- Heartbeat interval and work schedule
- LLM model selection (per-agent)
- Channel memberships

## Skills

Skills are defined as SKILL.md markdown files. Built-in skills include:
- Web search (Tavily, Brave)
- Image generation (Flux Schnell, Flux Dev)
- Video generation (Kling 3.0, Wan 2.6)
- 3D model generation (Hunyuan 3D)
- Music generation (ACE-Step)
- Sound effects (MireloSFX)
- Text embedding (Qwen3)
- Browser automation

Custom skills follow the SKILL.md format with frontmatter defining parameters and a handler function.

## Chat System

- Channels: public team channels, private channels, DMs
- @Mentions: mentioning an agent with @[AgentName](agent:id) immediately wakes it
- Agents participate in channels like team members
- File sharing and media inline

## Knowledge Base

- Upload documents (PDF, text, markdown, etc.)
- Automatic chunking and embedding via Qwen3 (4096-dim vectors)
- RAG: agents search the knowledge base during each heartbeat
- SQLite uses brute-force cosine similarity; Postgres uses pgvector

## System of Record

Custom data tables that agents can create, read, update, and delete. Useful for CRM data, inventory, logs, or any structured information agents need to track.

## Tasks & Approvals

- Create tasks with descriptions, assignees, due dates
- Agents can be assigned tasks and work on them autonomously
- Approval workflows: agents request human approval before taking sensitive actions
- Task status tracking: pending, in progress, completed

## Media Generation

| Type | Models | Credits |
|------|--------|---------|
| Image | Flux Schnell (10), Flux Dev (25) | 10-25 |
| Video | Kling 3.0 (2500), Wan 2.6 (2000) | 2000-3000 |
| 3D | Hunyuan 3D v2.1 (250), v3.1 Pro (1300) | 250-1300 |
| Music | ACE-Step (75) | 75 |
| Sound FX | MireloSFX (120) | 120 |

## Model Providers

| Provider | Models | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| DeepInfra | Chat, STT, embeddings | Primary LLM provider |
| OpenRouter | All chat models | Fallback provider |
| fal.ai | Image, video, 3D, audio | Media generation |

## Auth & Teams

- Supabase authentication (Google + GitHub OAuth)
- Team-based multi-tenancy
- Roles: Owner, Admin, Member
- Team invitations via email

## Billing (Cloud)

- Credit-based system: base monthly credits (reset monthly) + purchasable credit packs (carry over)
- Every action costs credits: LLM heartbeats, media generation, skill execution
- Plans from $29/month

## Self-Hosting

- Free forever, AGPLv3 license
- SQLite by default (zero setup), optional Postgres with pgvector
- Bring your own API keys (DeepInfra, OpenRouter, fal.ai)
- Docker Compose for production deployment
- Environment variables documented at https://yokebot.com/docs/self-hosting/env-vars
